# This is a RAG created as a complementary answer for a test
## The RAG was set to run utilizing my Azure AI settings, therefore if it stops works its because I changed something in Azure
## The goal is to generate a summary with critical opinions about a subtopics Learning (Adaptive Learning Technologies / The Role of Mastery Learning in Education)
### The subtopics were retrieved from different sources including Copilot, Gemini, my own opinion, OpenAI
### Text Analyzer was utilized to verify the sentiment on each source
### An AI search index was utilized to input all sources together
### Open AI was utilized to search for the summary of all sources and then generate a critical opinion from it
Thanks
