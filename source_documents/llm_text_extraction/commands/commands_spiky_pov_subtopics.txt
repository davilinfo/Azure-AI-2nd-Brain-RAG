Spiky POVs (each spiky POV initiate with a *): 
*Learning Approach: 1.A-Mastery Learning, where students don't move on to more difficult material unless they've mastered the prerequisites, is 2x - 5x more efficient than "conveyor belt" systems that move students ahead in curriculums based on their age. 
*Testing and Assessment: 2.B-Standardized tests aren't a necessary evil - they're a powerful tool for ensuring consistent, high-quality education at scale.
