Formative Assessment Strategies: Formative assessment strategies involve ongoing assessments that provide immediate feedback to students and educators about the learning process. Unlike summative assessments, which evaluate student learning at the end of an instructional period, formative assessments are integrated into the daily learning activities. These strategies include quizzes, peer reviews, self-assessments, and interactive activities that help gauge student understanding in real-time. Formative assessments support mastery learning by identifying gaps in knowledge and allowing for timely interventions. They also enhance the effectiveness of standardized tests by ensuring that students are well-prepared and have truly mastered the material before taking high-stakes exams.
