Adaptive Learning Technologies: Adaptive learning technologies are digital tools and platforms that adjust the learning experience based on the individual needs and progress of each student. These technologies use data analytics and artificial intelligence to monitor student performance, identify areas of strength and weakness, and provide personalized learning paths. By ensuring that students master each concept before moving on to more complex material, adaptive learning technologies align with the principles of mastery learning. They help create a more efficient and effective learning environment by catering to the unique pace and learning style of each student.
